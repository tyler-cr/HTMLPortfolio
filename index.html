            <h3>Film, Game Dev, and Machine Learning Nerd</h3>
            <p>Hey there, I'm Tyler Crimando and thanks for looking at my page! I'm a film and writing editor, producer, and 
                programmer, with a strong passion for both the creative and technical aspects of my work.
                I've been fascinated with film since I was young, and I love being part of the process that brings stories to 
                life on screen. Whether it's working with a director to shape the narrative, collaborating with a cinematographer
                 to create stunning visuals, or putting the finishing touches on a final cut, I'm always excited about the 
                 creative possibilities of film editing and producing.
                At the same time, I'm also passionate about programming and building things with technology. There's something 
                incredibly satisfying about solving problems with code and seeing how it can make a real-world impact. I've spent 
                a lot of time working with C++ and Python, and I love the challenges and opportunities that come with these languages.
                When I'm not working on film or programming projects, you can usually find me at the gym powerlifting or outside doing 
                analog photography. I love spending time in nature and finding inspiration for my work in the world around me.
                I've had the pleasure of working with a diverse range of clients and collaborators, from independent filmmakers to tech 
                startups. I'm always looking for new opportunities to connect with people and bring fresh perspectives to creative projects.
                If you're interested in learning more about my work or have a project you'd like to discuss, I'd love to hear from you. 
                Feel free to reach out anytime, and let's see what we can create together!</p>
